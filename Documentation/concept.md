# ACS Data Simplification Application - Project Concept

## Overview
The American Community Survey (ACS) Data Simplification Application is designed to democratize data access by streamlining and enhancing the process of working with ACS data. This web-based tool focuses on making ACS data more accessible through an intuitive user interface for complex API calls, eliminating the need for in-depth R or Python knowledge.

## Current Problems Addressed
1. **Inconsistent Variable Names**: Data variables and names change year to year independently, making tracking and comparing data across time periods difficult.
2. **Complex Technical Requirements**: Using ACS data typically requires significant technical knowledge.
3. **Scattered Documentation**: Information about variables and their meanings is spread across multiple sources.
4. **API Complexity**: Making Census Bureau API calls requires technical expertise.

## Core Features
1. **Intuitive Variable Selection**
    - Easy year selection
    - User-friendly variable selection interface

2. **Automatic Code Adjustment**
    - Automatic variable code adjustment across years
    - Consistency checking for changes in variable codes/titles
    - Automatic code mapping for different years

3. **Geographic Customization**
    - Multiple geographic level selection options
    - Cross-geographic area comparison capabilities

4. **API Integration**
    - Direct Census Bureau API integration
    - Automatic API key management
    - Request optimization

5. **User Management**
    - Account creation and management
    - Query and preference saving
    - Secure authentication system

6. **Data Management**
    - Efficient caching system
    - Multiple export formats
    - Data visualization capabilities

## Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Python with Flask/Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based system
- **API Handling**: Python Requests library
- **Caching**: Redis implementation
- **Security**: Full implementation of OWASP security guidelines

## Benefits
1. Reduced time and effort for ACS data work
2. Elimination of manual variable code checking
3. Instant data visualization
4. User-friendly interface for complex operations
5. Consistent data accuracy across years

## Future Expansion Possibilities
1. Additional data sources integration
2. Advanced visualization tools
3. Machine learning-based data analysis
4. Collaborative features
5. API endpoint for third-party integration
